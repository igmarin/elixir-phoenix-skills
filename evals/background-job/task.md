# Background Job Task

## Problem

An Elixir/Phoenix team needs help with a task in this area:

Orchestrates robust Oban background job implementation with hard gates: design job with idempotency strategy and error classification (transient→retry, permanent→discard) → TDD implementation where test MUST fail before code → configure retry/discard strategies → test failure scenarios covering idempotency/retry/error handling → production monitoring; phases design→TDD→retry config→failure testing→monitoring.

The team has asked for a concise implementation artifact that a reviewer can inspect without needing to observe the agent's process.

## Output

Create `answer.md` with:

- a short plan for the work
- the concrete Elixir/Phoenix-oriented artifact or recommendation
- the verification steps or quality gates that should be run
- any assumptions that affect the result
